            <h3>Romance with Poems</h3>
            Oh! I have slipped the surly bonds of Earth<br>
            And danced the skies on <strong>laughter-silvered wings</strong>;<br>
            Sunward I've climbed, and joined the tumbling mirth<br>
            of <em>sun-split clouds</em>,—and done a hundred things<br>
            You have not dreamed of—wheeled and soared and swung<br>
            High in the sunlit silence...<br>
